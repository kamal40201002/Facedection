Face detection is a computer vision technology used to locate and identify human faces within digital images or video frames. It is a crucial component in various applications, including facial recognition, video surveillance, emotion analysis, and more. Here's how face detection typically works:

Image Input: Face detection begins with an input image or a frame from a video stream. This image can be in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or a video frame.

Preprocessing: Before face detection, the image may undergo preprocessing to enhance its quality, reduce noise, or normalize lighting conditions. This step can improve the accuracy of face detection algorithms.

Feature Extraction: In this step, the algorithm analyzes the image to extract relevant features, such as edges, shapes, and textures. These features help in identifying potential face regions.

Face Detection Algorithm: Various algorithms and techniques can be used for face detection. Some popular methods include:
